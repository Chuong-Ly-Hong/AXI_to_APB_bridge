# AXI_to_APB_bridge
AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) is a well-established set of protocols developed by ARM for designing and interfacing components in a System-on-Chip (SoC) environment.
AMBA protocols facilitate efficient communication between various IP (Intellectual Property) blocks within an SoC, such as processors, memory controllers, peripherals, and more.
The 2 protocols that I have designed using Verilog RTL:
  APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)
  AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)
